# Underwater Trash Detection

This project focuses on detecting underwater trash using a stationary camera. The detection process involves collecting and preparing data, extracting trash from video frames, and recreating the output video with bounding boxes around detected trash objects.

## Abstract
In this challenge, we focused mainly on choosing good datasets, training well, and selecting a well prediction threshold for the trash in the video.

## Data Collection
We used the Trash-ICRA19 dataset, labeling data on fish and trash. The data was collected from various sources and annotated using bounding boxes.

## Data Preparation
The data was pulled using Google Drive API and transferred to a custom vision service. We trained the data and assigned regions to the objects.

## Trash Detection
The detection process involves fetching the video URL, cutting it into frames, and passing frames to a custom vision service to detect trash objects. The service returns bounding boxes around detected trash objects, which are then drawn on the frames.

## Video Processing
After processing the frames, they are stacked again to recreate the output video with detected trash objects.

## Lessons Learned
We faced challenges with subscription quotas and had to use multiple accounts to complete the task.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MatthewNader2/Underwater-Trash-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Underwater-Trash-Detection
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the data collection script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_collection.py
   ```
2. Run the data preparation script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_preparation.py
   ```
3. Run the trash detection script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/trash_detection.py
   ```
4. Run the video processing script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/video_processing.py
